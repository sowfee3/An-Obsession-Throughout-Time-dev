OFFICIAL STORY (This may be prone to changes)

Chapter 1, Monday

The Player encounters a new girl in school, this new girl at school befriends the Player and the more the Player is around the new girl, the more they see creepy stuff at school. The new girl then gives her address at dismissal.

Later that day when the Player arrives home, they encounter their mother cleaning the attic. The Player then stumbles upon a photo of her mother and a person that looks like the new girl. You can decide to keep the image or not (this may be crucial in the story, we could tempt the player to not keep the image due to backpack space). 

Chapter 2, Tuesday

The new girl then tries to kill the Player by drowning her. When the player escapes the beach and back home, she tells her mom about the new girl. 

These things involve the murderous intent of the new girl and her creepy hallucinations at school after meeting the new girl.

The mom is unfazed by the things the Player is telling the mom. (IF YOU KEPT THE PHOTO IN THE ATTIC, the Player has the option to show the mom the photo. If she shows the photo, the mom stays silent the entire night). After this, the doorbell rang. There was a pizza delivery. So they both ate dinner, and they both
